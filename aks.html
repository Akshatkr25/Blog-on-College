                &nbsp; College life is very different from high school life. It can be a lot more fun, but it's also
                more demanding.
                You'll have a lot more flexibility with your college classes, but a lot more responsibility as well.
                One week in college, and you know it is nothing like the movies. But my dear friend, have patience.
                You probably feel like a deer in headlights now, but worry not, this might seem scary for the first
                time, but college teaches you life skills that are required for building a proficient life and surviving
                as a
                grown individual.
            </p>

                    Adjustment
                </li>

            <p class="style">
                Nowadays, most of us belong to nuclear families, with the conclusion of the joint family culture;
                one of the fundamental skills that are missing in today’s youth knows how to adjust with people.
                We are born and brought up with a lot of care and pampering from our parents, wherein we receive the
                utmost attention a person can give.
                <br>
                &nbsp; However, we cannot stubbornly follow our own timetable but have to adjust with the people in our rooms.
                And believe me, if you don’t know how to adjust, life is going to be exceptionally troublesome once you
                enter professional life. College is the perfect place that makes you more flexible in adjusting to
                different kinds of people taking you out of your comfort zone.
            </p>

            <h3 class="uppercase">
                <li>
                    Time Management
                </li>
            </h3>

            <p class="style">
                Remember the days when your mom made sure you get up early on time for all your commitments as if it is
                her responsibility?
                Well, once you enter college, you are all on your own. One might face difficulties in the initial stages
                but after a while, you know when to wake up for classes, when to have food, when to study and when to go
                to bed! You become self-reliant.
                You learn how to oversee your time so that you just don’t have to surge at the last moment. Also, you
                become organized. You know how to take care of your things and how to live on your own.
            </p>

            <h3 class="uppercase">
                <li>
                    Independence
                </li>
            </h3>

            <p class="style">
                Once you move into college, all your life decisions are yours. Your actions might have a repercussion on
                something else. Once you get a chance of making independent decisions, your faults and imprudence do not
                exclusively influence you, but might have an impact on someone else. You need to stay with people who
                have different opinions from all over the world and live collaboratively while keeping your own ideals
                intact.
            </p>

            <h3 class="uppercase">
                <li>
                    Conclusion
                </li>
            </h3>
            <p class="style">
                But the most important thing you’ll find in college is your true self. The things that motivate you, the
                tribe that you belong in, from recognizing your irks to learning what works for you, you will discover
                every
                little thing about yourself. College life is the first step towards independence, and with independence
                comes opportunities. It is completely on us how we use them. So all in all, if you are a fresher in
                college,
                you are beginning the best days of your life. The memories you will make will be just as precious and
                important as the skills you will learn, and you will find yourself to be a mature, understanding, and
                self-dependent
                individual!
